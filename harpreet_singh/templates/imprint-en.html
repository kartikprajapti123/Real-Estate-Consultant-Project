        <h3>Right of Withdrawal for Purchase Contracts Including Real Estate Services</h3>
        <p>Consumers have a statutory right of withdrawal. A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly outside their trade or independent professional activity. (§ 13 BGB)</p>
        
        <h4>Right of Withdrawal</h4>
        <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal period is fourteen days from the day on which you or a third party designated by you takes possession of the goods or property.</p>
        <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (full name, full address, phone number, email address) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post or an email). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but this is not mandatory.</p>

        <p>To comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient for you to send the notification regarding the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

        <h4>Consequences of Withdrawal</h4>
        <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we will refund all payments we have received from you, including the delivery costs (except for additional costs arising from your choice of a delivery method other than the cheapest standard delivery), immediately and no later than fourteen days from the day we receive the notification of your withdrawal from this contract. For this refund, we will use the same payment method you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in any case, no fees will be charged for this refund.</p>

        <p>We may refuse the refund until we have received the goods back or until you have provided evidence that you have returned the goods, whichever occurs first.</p>

        <p>You must return the goods to us immediately and in any case no later than fourteen days from the day you inform us of the withdrawal from this contract. This deadline is met if you send the goods before the fourteen-day period expires.</p>

        <p>You will bear the direct costs of returning the goods.</p>

        <p>You are only liable for any loss in value of the goods if this loss in value is due to handling of the goods that was not necessary to examine the nature, properties, and functioning of the goods.</p>

        <p>If you requested that services begin during the withdrawal period, you must pay us an amount that corresponds to the portion of the services already provided up to the point at which you inform us of the exercise of the right of withdrawal with respect to this contract, in comparison to the total scope of services provided for in the contract.</p>
